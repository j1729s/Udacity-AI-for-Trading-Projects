# Udacity-AI-for-Trading-Project
These are my own rendition of the Udacity Artificial Intelligence for Trading course. I didn't have access to the data they provided or the courses but I did have access to the project descriptions on Github. So I collated data through various APIs to make a Historical prices dataframe for myself on which I can base these projects. Please have a look. Thanks!
